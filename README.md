# Advent of Code

This repository is used to ensure I don't lose the files :sweat_smile: but also to document various languages / concepts explored during the Advent of Code challenges.

The input texts and answers are not included to encourage you to actually go through the Advent of Code challenges and learn something along the journey.

Any feedback is welcome, feel free to raise issues or contribute better solutions!
