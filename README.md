# Advent of Code

This repository is used to ensure I don't lose the files :sweat_smile: but also to document various languages / concepts explored during the Advent of Code challenges.

The input texts and answers are not included to encourage you to actually go through the Advent of Code challenges and learn something along the journey.

Any feedback is welcome, feel free to raise issues or contribute better solutions!

P.S. - For the eagle eyed amongst you, yes I started at 2020. The plan is to go through years 2015-2019 after I have completed 2020! Or re-do 2020 in different language(s)....

## Day Specific Notes

### Day 5

Day 5 was an interesting one for me, my first thought was this is screaming a Binary Search Tree but I couldn't quickly get my head around the data structure, whether this is because it was around midnight and I'd had a couple of beers or not I'm not sure, instead I went for a slightly messy implementation but, in theory, it should be easy enough to extend if the number of columns or rows increased on the plane! But still, a few too many Arrays even for my liking.

This is definitely a problem I'll be revisiting, most likely in another language though.
